ABSTRACT

On the most recent State of the Game podcast, there was discussion of
MLG's extended series rule in their double elimination
tournament. This post explores the effects of the extended series rule
on tournament outcomes, using a simplified model of players and
tournaments. Several tournament formats are explored: round robin,
single elimination, double elimination, and double elimination with
extended series. Performance is measured by averaging over many
simulations, using several distance metrics from the 'ideal ranking'
of players.  Results show a small but measurable improvement in
performance when using the extended series rule; with 64 players in a
best-of-three format, the 'best player' wins 1% more often (25%
compared to 24%) using the extended series rule than with simple
double elimination. However, the improvement from the extended series
rule is marginal compared to the overall tournament format; in
single-elimination, the best player wins 19% of the time, and in
round-robin the best player wins 47% of the time.

1. INTRODUCTION

MLG is the largest Starcraft II tournament in North America, and
consequently its tournament format has a large impact on the
competitive scene. MLG employs a fairly standard double-elimination
tournament format, with each round determined by a best-of-three
series. However, MLG has an additional wrinkle called 'extended
series', which many people find counter-intuitive. To explain these
complexities, let's start with an overview of different tournament
formats.

A single elimination tournament is the simplest format that most
people are familiar with. Play proceeds in rounds, with all players
starting in the same round. Players are then paired in each round and
play a series. The winner proceeds to the next round, and the loser is
eliminated from the tournament. This format has the advantage of
determining a champion in very few games (O(log(# of players))), but
the disadvantage that bad luck can knock out good players at an early
stage.

To help with this problem, double elimination tournaments ensure that
any player must lose twice in order to knocked out of the
tournament. This is done by having two brackets: 'winners' and
'losers'. All players begin in the winners' bracket, and after losing
once are sent to the losers'. Players in the loser's bracket play each
other, as well as all players who join the losers' bracket from the
winner's bracket. Therefore, players in the losers' bracket play
twice as many series as those in the winners'.

MLG has extended the double elimination format with an 'extended
series' rule that is invoked when players meet twice in a single
tournament. If players meet in the winners' bracket, and later again
in the losers' bracket, then instead of playing a new best-of-three
series, their series from the winners' bracket is resumed as a
best-of-seven series. Example: If Alice beats Bob 2-1 in the winners'
bracket, and they meet again in the losers' bracket, then they will
play a best-of-seven series to determine the winner with a starting
score 2-1 in favor of Alice. Alice has to win two games to proceed,
and Bob has to win three.

This rule is intended to avoid some paradoxical outcomes, as well as
statistically increase the likelihood that the 'better player'
continues in the tournament. It is possible in standard double
elimination for Alice to defeat Bob 2-1 in the winners', and Bob to
defeat Alice in the losers' 2-0. The "overall series" between Alice
and Bob is 3-2 in Alice's favor, but Bob continues and Alice does
not.

Similarly, another argument is that double elimination exists in order
to give better players a 'second chance' to continue in the tournament
when defeated by inferior players, but this logic does not apply when
the same players meet again. In this case, it makes more sense (so the
argument goes) to extend the series to determine the 'better player'.

Despite these arguments, the extended series has generated
controversy, because in many instances the tournament setting is very
different when the series resumes, and many people find it
unentertaining and counter-intuitive.

In particular, the extended series between Liquid`Tyler and PainUser
at MLG Dallas demonstrates some of the problems. In their series in
the winners' bracket, Liquid`Tyler fell victim to a mistake of the
tournament organizers, and was forced to restart a game that he had a
clear advantage. Liquid`Tyler subsequently lost the series 2-0, which
some have argued was due to the psychological effect of the game
restart. When they later met in the losers' bracket, Liquid`Tyler was
at a significant disadvantage, and lost the extended series 2-4, but
would have won a best-of-three.

This post is organized into several sections. Section 2 describes how
these results were gathered, and the various models used. Section 3
describes the experimental setup. Section 4 presents the
results. Section 5 concludes, and Section 6 shows where to follow up
on this if you are interested.

1.1 SCOPE

This post is an in-depth analysis of the statistical performance of
different tournament formats. It is not concerned with many other
important questions, for example:

  * What is the purpose of tournaments, beyond determining skill of
    players?

  * Is the extended series rule entertaining?

  * Is the extended series rule morally justified?

  * Players aren't strictly 'better' or 'worse' than each other -- or,
    at least, this relationship isn't transitive between players.

  * The tournament setting can change when an extended series resumes.

These questions will and have been addressed elsewhere.
